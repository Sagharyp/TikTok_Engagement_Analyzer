## Project Overview
Understanding digital consumption patterns has become increasingly important in recent years, where social media plays a significant role in most people's daily lives. This project aims to analyze my personal TikTok usage over the past six months, identifying correlations between usage patterns and various external and personal factors. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates future TikTok consumption based on these influencing variables.

---

## Motivation
Since TikTok is the social media app I use the most, analyzing my consumption patterns can provide valuable insights into behavioral trends. It will also allow me to make more informed decisions/predictions about my screen time and digital well-being.

---

## Objectives  
- **Analyze** TikTok usage patterns over a few months.  
- **Identify factors** influencing engagement (like global events, weather, and academic schedules).  
- **Build a predictive model** for future TikTok consumption.  
- **Apply data science skills** in a real world context.  

---

## Research Questions
1. What factors influence the TikTok usage on a daily basis?
2. How does the **temperature and weather** conditions affect TikTok consumption?
3. How does **academic workload** (exams, class schedules) influence TikTok consumption?
4. What role do **global events** (e.g., award shows, elections, cultural events) play in influencing TikTok consumption?  
5. Can I make a predictive model to estimate my future TikTok consumption based on these factors?  
6. Perhaps, can I use these findings to optimize my social media(Tiktok) consumption?  

---

## Hypotheses and Results

### üìÖ Day
- **H1:** TikTok usage may follow a time trend over the semester (increasing or decreasing gradually).  
  **Result:** It did in fact show a lot of fluctuations.

### ‚è±Ô∏è TikTok Usage (Hours)
- **H2:** TikTok usage is influenced by personal habits, external events, and environmental factors.  
  **Result:** Even if not always strong correlations, it seems there are effects of the factors.

### üå°Ô∏è Temperature Feels Like

- **H8:** TikTok usage may increase during Ramazan.  
  **Result:** No strong correlation found.

### üéâ 1404 Nowruz (Countdown)
- **H9:** Leading up to Nowruz, TikTok usage may increase due to cultural or celebratory content.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the event is closer.

### üéä 2025 New Year (Countdown)
- **H10:** TikTok usage may increase around New Year's Day.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the event is closer.

## Machine Learning Models & Prediction

### Dataset Overview
The analysis was conducted on **245 days** of data with **21 features**, including weather conditions, global events, and personal factors.

### Models Tested
Four different machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**

### Baseline Models
Simple baseline predictors were established for comparison:
- **Mean Predictor**: MAE = 98.79 videos
- **Median Predictor**: MAE = 93.46 videos (best baseline)

### Cross-Validation Results
Using time-series cross-validation with 5 splits:

| Model | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) |
|-------|---------------------------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 108.22 ¬± 17.82 |
| Random Forest | 114.21 ¬± 22.93 |
| Linear Regression | 134.05 ¬± 33.11 |
| Decision Tree | 151.38 ¬± 37.99 |

### Test Set Performance
Unfortunately, all machine learning models performed worse than the baseline on the test set:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R¬≤ Score |
|-------|-----|------|----------|
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 179.01 | 202.03 | -3.525 |
| Random Forest | 179.23 | 204.20 | -3.623 |
| Linear Regression | 231.40 | 253.89 | -6.147 |
| Decision Tree | 294.37 | 323.20 | -10.581 |

**Note:** All models showed negative R¬≤ scores, indicating they performed worse than simply predicting the mean.

## Key Findings

### Statistical vs. Practical Significance
While most statistical tests did not return significant p-values, several visual patterns were observed:
- **UEFA matches** showed noticeable impact on usage
- **Fashion Week** periods correlated with increased consumption  
- **Weekend vs. weekday** patterns were clearly evident
- **Major events** (Grammy Awards, Oscars, Nowruz, New Year) showed trending effects

These patterns suggest real-world effects that may become statistically significant with more data or additional features.

### Model Performance Insights
The machine learning models struggled to predict TikTok usage accurately, with the **Median Predictor baseline** (MAE = 93.46) outperforming all sophisticated models. This suggests that:
- Current features may not capture the complexity of social media consumption patterns
- More data or different feature engineering approaches may be needed
- Personal usage patterns might be more random than initially hypothesized

---

## Future Work

To improve the predictive model performance, future work will focus on:

- **Data Collection**: Gathering more days of usage data for better model training
- **Feature Engineering**: 
  - Adding more granular time-based features (hour of day, day of week interactions)
  - Including content-based features (trending topics, personal interests)
  - Perhaps incorporating mood or emotional state indicators
