## Project Overview
Understanding digital consumption patterns has become increasingly important in recent years, where social media plays a significant role in most people's daily lives. This project aims to analyze my personal TikTok usage over the past six months, identifying correlations between usage patterns and various external and personal factors. The ultimate goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates future TikTok consumption based on these influencing variables.

---

## Motivation
Since TikTok is the social media app I use the most, analyzing my consumption patterns can provide valuable insights into behavioral trends. It will also allow me to make more informed decisions/predictions about my screen time and digital well-being.

---

## Objectives  
- **Analyze** TikTok usage patterns over a few months.  
- **Identify factors** influencing engagement (like global events, weather, and academic schedules).  
- **Build a predictive model** for future TikTok consumption.  
- **Apply data science skills** in a real world context.  

---

## Research Questions
1. What factors influence the TikTok usage on a daily basis?
2. How does the **temperature and weather** conditions affect TikTok consumption?
3. How does **academic workload** (exams, class schedules) influence TikTok consumption?
4. What role do **global events** (e.g., award shows, elections, cultural events) play in influencing TikTok consumption?  
5. Can I make a predictive model to estimate my future TikTok consumption based on these factors?  
6. Perhaps, can I use these findings to optimize my social media(Tiktok) consumption?  

---

## Data Collection & Sources
The analysis will be conducted using both personal data collected directly from TikTok and additional data from external sources that may influence my media consumption:

### The Primary Data Source:
  - Total hours spent on TikTok daily. *(Calculated from the TikTok app data)*
  - Total number of videos watched on TikTok daily. *(Collected through TikTok app)*

### External Influencing Factors:
   - **Major Global Events**
     - Religious
     - Political
     - Social/Cultural
     - Music-related
     - Sports-related
     - Fashion-related
     - Competitions/Award shows
     - Etc. *(All collected through manual research or calendars)*

   - **Weather Conditions**
     - Temperature *(Collected through Weather API)*
     - Precipitation *(Collected through Weather API)*
     - Snow *(Collected through Weather API)*
     - Snow Depth *(Collected through Weather API)*
     - UV Index *(Collected through Weather API)*

### Personal Influencing Factors:
   - **Academic Responsibilities**
     - Academic Calender *(Collected through Sabancƒ± University Website)*
   - **Weekend/Weekday**
     - Weekend/Weekday because of free time *(Collected through calendar)*

## Hypotheses and Results

### üìÖ Day
- **H1:** TikTok usage may follow a time trend over the semester (increasing or decreasing gradually).  
  **Result:** It did in fact show a lot of fluctuations.

### ‚è±Ô∏è TikTok Usage (Hours)
- **H2:** TikTok usage is influenced by personal habits, external events, and environmental factors.  
  **Result:** Even if not always strong correlations, it seems there are effects of the factors.

### üå°Ô∏è Temperature Feels Like
- **H3:** Lower temperatures lead to higher TikTok usage, as I prefer staying indoors.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the temperature is between 10‚Äì15¬∞C.

### üåßÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è Precipitation, Snow, Snow Depth, UV Index
- **H4:** Rainy/snowy days are associated with increased TikTok usage.  
  **Result:** No strong correlation found.

### üéµ 2025 Grammy Awards (Countdown)
- **H5:** TikTok usage increases near major music events due to trending content and artists.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the event is closer.

### üé¨ 2025 Oscar Awards (Countdown)
- **H6:** Usage increases around the Oscars.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the event is closer.

### üëó 2025 Paris Fashion Week (Bool)
- **H7:** TikTok usage may increase during Fashion Week.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the event is closer.

### üïå 2025 Ramazan (Bool)
- **H8:** TikTok usage may increase during Ramazan.  
  **Result:** No strong correlation found.

### üéâ 1404 Nowruz (Countdown)
- **H9:** Leading up to Nowruz, TikTok usage may increase due to cultural or celebratory content.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the event is closer.

### üéä 2025 New Year (Countdown)
- **H10:** TikTok usage may increase around New Year‚Äôs Day.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time when the event is closer.

### üó≥Ô∏è 2024 United States Presidential Election (Countdown)
- **H11:** Usage may increase during this period.  
  **Result:** No strong correlation found.

### ‚öΩ 24/25 UEFA Champions League (Bool)
- **H12:** Matches or finals may influence TikTok usage.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time on the match days.

### üéì 24/25 School Year (Bool)
- **H13:** TikTok usage is lower during the active school year compared to breaks or holidays.  
  **Result:** Need more data.

### üìÜ Weekday (Bool)
- **H14:** Weekdays are associated with less TikTok usage due to academic schedule and deadlines.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend less time on the weekdays.

### üõå Weekend (Bool)
- **H15:** Weekends are associated with higher TikTok usage due to more free time.  
  **Result:** It is observed that I spend more time on the weekends.
